Elements of Programming Interviews

This is an unofficial repository of programs from "Elements of Programming 
Interviews in Python," by Adnan Azis, Tsung-Hsien Lee, and Amit Prakash. The
Python programs are from the book, others are my translation. The original authors also produce versions of the book for
C++ and Java.

No copyright infringement is intended by this repository. It is primarily for
my own edification but perhaps for others'. I highly recommend buying the book
for all the commentary involved. None of the prose is reproduced here.

Please see https://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/ and support the authors
by buying from Amazon. Just ensure that you buy directly from Amazon, so you
are certain to get the larger format text, which is much easier to read (it is
not large type, the older editions are simply too small for most readers).
